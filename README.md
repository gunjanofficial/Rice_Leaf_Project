# Rice_Leaf_Project
Domain Analysis:
This dataset contains 120 jpg images of disease-infected rice leaves. The images are grouped into 3 classes based on the type of disease. There are 40 images in each class.

Classes:

Leaf smut :leaf smuf is a minor fungal diseases.It is widespread where rice is grown, but leaf smut doesn’t often cause serious damage and In most situations, there is no major loss caused by rice leaf smut, so treatment isn’t usually given.

Brown spot: Brown spot is the most common and damaging rice diseases.This fungal disease that infects the coleoptile,leaves,leaf sheath and panicle branches etc.it can survive in the seed for more than four years and can spread from plant to plant through air and can occur at all crop stages.it can cause significant yield losses and economic damage to farmers.

Bacterial leaf blight : Bacterial blight is the most serious diseases of rice.Bacterial blight is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. it is commonly observed when strong winds and continuous heavy rain occur.This becteria infected leaves turn into grayish green and roll up.Bacterial leaf blight can cause significant yield losses and economic damage to farmers.


# Data analysis report
In this project i have used the CNN deep learning model and got the training accuracy score 0.87% and validation accuracy 0.90%,
if see training accuarcy is slightly lower as compared to validation accuracy,
suggesting that the model is generalizing reasonably well to unseen data.I will consider CNN model is good for rice leaf diseases for prediction.
model will perform very well during the rice leaf prediction becuase model correct accuracy score is 90%.
